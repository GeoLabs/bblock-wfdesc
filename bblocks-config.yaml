abstract: |
  This register provides Building Blocks for the Wf4Ever ontologies, 
  enabling semantic description of computational workflows, their execution provenance, 
  and research object packaging. It includes wfdesc (Workflow Description), 
  wfprov (Workflow Provenance), and ro (Research Object) ontologies.

description: |
  The Wf4Ever (Workflow Forever) project developed a comprehensive set of ontologies 
  for describing computational workflows and research objects. This Building Block provides 
  JSON-LD contexts and schema definitions to use these concepts in a standardized way.
  
  **Key Features:**
  - Workflow structure description (wfdesc)
  - Execution provenance tracking (wfprov extending PROV-O)
  - Research object aggregation and packaging (ro)
  - Compatible with CWL (Common Workflow Language) provenance
  
  **Use Cases:**
  - Scientific workflow documentation
  - Reproducibility and provenance tracking
  - Research data packaging
  - Workflow discovery and reuse
